	<div class="p-3">
		<div class="jumbotron">
			<p class="lead">This website is the answer of this question! I explain it you <strong>right now</strong>.</p>
		</div>
		<p>Fact:</p>
		<p>Humankind started to make films at the end of the 19th century. Since then the film industry grew rapidly. Nowadays we have access to hundreds of thousands of movies. Because we are mortals and we don’t have infinite time, we can’t possibly watch all of them.</p>
		<p>That makes you ask the question:</p>
		<p><strong>What movie should I watch?</strong></p>
		<div class="jumbotron">
			<p class="lead">There are more movies than we can possibly watch!</p>
			<div class="quote-line">
				<div class="mb-2">In the past 10 years, film production has doubled, going from 4,584 in 2005, to 9,387 in 2015. <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-films-are-produced-each-year" target="_blank"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<p>That means:</p>
		<p><strong>No time to waste on bad movies!</strong></p>
		<p>If you came here to get some movie recommendations from somebody who may or may not share the same movie taste with you, you may scroll down to the bottom of the page for that. Even so I didn’t create this page to announce my “Top 100 Greatest Movies of All Time”.</p>
		<p>Look:</p>
		<p>When you search movies on internet, you will possibly end up at lists which are created by individuals. Of course there is a chance that these individuals share similar movie taste with you but in my opinion it is less likely. You may end up at some websites which display top 250 lists and so on but this lists are created by everyone. And if you don’t share similar movie taste with majority… On the other hand, Topcorn.io offers <strong>customized movie recommendation</strong> list in addition to all of them.</p>
		<div class="jumbotron">
			<p class="lead">Everyone has a friend who recommends you which movies you should watch. Eventhough you are not interested in that kind of movies at all.</p><hr class="my-4">
  			<p>Topcorn.io doesn't only understand what you like, it also understands what you don't like!</p>
		</div>
		<p>Here's the deal:</p>
		<p>This page is a hook so you can reach this website. If you want to get the answer of the question immediately, then you can simply skip reading this long post and start using this personalized movie recommendation engine.</p>
		<div class="jumbotron">
			<p class="lead">Start using Topcorn.io to get movie recommendations according to your unique movie taste now.</p>
		</div>
		<p>You can create an account with your facebook account or with your email address easily and quickly. You don’t even have to confirm your email address.</p>
		<p>If it is still too much work to do, you can just go to the recommendations page and define your mood with several movies and get your movie suggestions according to that mood.</p>
		<p>But here's the kicker:</p>
		<p>It can be told that, creating a strong profile and filtering the results afterwards is more effective than defining the mood with several movies.</p>
		<div class="jumbotron">
			<p class="lead">Create and strengthen your profile quickly!</p>
		</div>
		<p>Now:</p>
		<p>There are several ways of strengthening your profile. Firstly, you can use quick vote feature. Through the quick vote button you can sequentially vote the most frequently voted movies by other users. Secondly, you can search&vote. In addition to them you can go to the page of your favourite actors or directors to vote their movies.</p>
		<div class="jumbotron">
			<p class="lead">Quick vote brings you the most frequently voted movies.</p>
		</div>
		<p>Here's the deal:</p>
		<p>When you watch a movie, you can add it to your watched movies. You should vote the movies consistently.</p>
		<p>That doesn't mean that you should spend a lot of time on voting movies. You can decide the first option come to mind.</p>
		<p>Don't worry:</p>
		<p>You can always go back and vote the movies again.</p>
		<img src="/images/yoda_vote_consistently.png" class="img-fluid mb-4 mt-1" alt="Yoda Votes More Consistently">
		<p>I don’t really have to tell you to how to use this website because it is quite easy to use; however like I said before, this is a hook page for the search results so you can find the real product. And you found the tool to answer your question. 
		</p>
		<div class="jumbotron">
			<p class="lead">You will not have to overthink or oversearch the movie that you should watch tonight anymore.</p>
		</div>
		</p>There are 19351 of movies in the database currently and it is increasing everyday. So I invite you to use Topcorn.io. It is completely free and it will stay like this. On the other hand, I quit my job and I need to take some advertisements when the right time comes.</p>
		<div class="jumbotron">
			<p class="lead">Topcorn.io is completely free and it will stay like that!</p>
		</div>
		<p>After you create and strengthen your profile, you can get your customized movie recommendations right away.</p>
		<p>If you entered enough movies to the system, you will have a lot of movies in your list. You can use the filter to narrow the list down.</p>
		<div class="jumbotron">
			<p class="lead">Use filter to narrow down the movies by their original languages, genres, release years and minimum vote counts.</p>
		</div>
		<p>It gets better:</p>
		<p>If that filter is not enough complex for you and if you want to see more choices there, you can go to interface settings to enable advanced recommendations.</p>
		<p>You can also customize your profile&background pictures and many other things from there too.</p>
		<p>I am spending a lot of time on developing Topcorn.io. Every time when Topcorn.io has new users, that makes me really happy. I am glad if I can help other people to find some good movies to watch.</p>
		<div class="jumbotron">
			<p class="lead">There are some features of the website however you must enable advanced recommendations from the interface settings, in order to reveal them. They are hidden at the beginning because I realised that too much option can confuse the new users.</p>
		</div>
		<p>It gets much better:</p>
		<p>When I am with my friends/wife, there are two things that we can't decide.</p>
		<p>What to eat..</p>
		<p>..and what to watch</p>
		<p>Want to know the best part?</p>
		<p>You can add other users to your movie party and get the customized movie recommendations for the group.</p>
		<div class="jumbotron">
			<p class="lead">If you want to choose a movie to watch with your friends/family/partner, use "watch together" feature.</p>
		</div>
		<p><strong>Another use of Topcorn.io</strong></p>
		<p>Topcorn.io is created to give customized movie recommendation lists however you can create custom lists for any reason and you can share it with other users too.</p>
		<p>In this way:</p>
		<p>At the bottom section of the related movie detail pages, your lists will be shown. Thanks to that people can reach to your lists and your profile.</p>
		<p>In addition to them:</p>
		<p>You may share your links in your profile page in order to promote your social media accounts or your youtube channel or even your blog to get some extra traffic.</p>
